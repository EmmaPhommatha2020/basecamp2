// 6.1  Remember that you can use the + sign to combine string variables. 
//This is called concatenation. Initialize a variable called firstName with your first name in a string. 
//Then, initialize another variable called lastName with your last name as a string. 
//Finally, create a new variable, fullName and initialize it as the result of concatenating firstName and lastName. 
// CODE
var firstName = "Emma";
var lastName = "Phommatha";
var fullName = firstName + lastName;
console.log(fullName); // return => Emma Phommatha


//6.2  Initialize 3 new variables like the variable to the right, using any mathematical operators you like. 
//The variables should use a mathematical expression to evaluate to the number in the name of the variable. 
//Use this process to create the following variables:

//1.Your first variable should be called numTwo, and should have a mathematical expression that evaluates to 2.
//2.The second variable should be called numThree, and should evaluate to 3.
//3.The third variable should be called numFour, and should evaluate to 4.
var numberOne = 5 / 5;
//CODE
var numTwo = 1 + 1;
var numThree = 7 - 4;
var numFour = 2 * 2;
