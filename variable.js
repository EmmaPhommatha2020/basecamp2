//called sentence and initialize as equal to part1 plus part2. You can include variables
// as part of the definition of new variables. 
//All they are is words that represent other data, and the computer will evaluate them as such.
// In this case, each of the part1 and part2 variables represent part of a sentence, 
//and we can create a new variable that has the whole sentence by using the variables that already exist. 

// Combine the following variables into a new one using '+' on line 5
var part1 = "We are slowly learning";
